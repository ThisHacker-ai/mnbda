🌟 Requirements to Install SCVMM in a VM
Before installing System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) in a virtual machine, you need to prepare both the VM and the environment. Here’s a simple list you can copy into your journal.
________________


🔹 1️⃣ Prepare the VM
✅ A VM running Windows Server 2016, 2019, or 2022 (Standard or Datacenter Edition).
✅ At least 8 GB of RAM (16 GB recommended for good performance).
✅ At least 80 GB of disk space (more if you plan to manage many hosts).
✅ At least 2-4 CPU cores.
✅ Connect the VM to a network with access to the domain and SQL Server.
________________


🔹 2️⃣ Install Prerequisites Inside the VM
✅ .NET Framework 4.6 or higher.
✅ Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK).
✅ SQL Server instance (you can install it on the same VM or a separate server).
✅ Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) – optional, but good for patching.
✅ Join the VM to the Active Directory domain (needed for ADSI Edit and SCVMM configuration).
________________


🔹 3️⃣ Prepare Active Directory for SCVMM
✅ Use ADSI Edit to create a special container for SCVMM:
                                                               * Open Server Manager > Tools > ADSI Edit.

                                                               * Connect to the Default Naming Context.

                                                               * Navigate to your domain (e.g., DC=STUDENT,DC=COM).

                                                               * Right-click the domain container and select New > Object.

                                                               * Create a container object named VMMObjectContainer.

                                                               * Copy the distinguishedName (e.g., CN=VMMObjectContainer,DC=STUDENT,DC=COM).

This container helps SCVMM store and manage objects inside Active Directory.
________________


🔹 4️⃣ Service Account for SCVMM
✅ Create a domain user account with permissions to install SCVMM and access the SQL Server.
✅ Use this account to run the SCVMM setup.
________________


🔹 5️⃣ SQL Server
✅ You need a SQL Server instance (2016 or newer) for the SCVMM database.
✅ It can be on the same VM (for testing) or a separate server (for production).
________________


🔹 6️⃣ Network and Firewall
✅ Ensure the VM has network connectivity to the domain, hosts, and SQL Server.
✅ Open firewall ports needed for SCVMM and SQL Server.
